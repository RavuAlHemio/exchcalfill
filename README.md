# Exchange Calendar Filler

Command-line tool to quickly add many appointments to a Microsoft Exchange calendar.

Useful for situations where a day's appointments are announced in bulk.

Currently uses EWS (Exchange Web Services) with NTLM authentication, so only on-premises Exchange installations are supported.
